gabtastik-win
=============

A desktop client for web chat (Windows).

Note that most of the chat services available in Gabtastik have been discontinued (Google Talk is no longer available as an embedded widget, Facebook no longer supports pop-out chat and Meebo has been acquired by Google).  As such, the application is pretty much unusable, but perhaps some of the code here can be re-purposed.
